query port: 30889 (30141)
NAMED port number(Listen-on port): 62105 (62013)
RNDC port number: 49152 (49112)
PROXY port number:62106 (62014)

-------------------Part1:-------------------
 In this part, I used 'dig @127.0.0.1 -p 62105 utoronto.ca' to dig address using local DNS server, and for 
Mail, I used 'dig @127.0.0.1 -p 62105 utoronto.ca MX' to get the mail address.

-------------------Part2:-------------------
 In this part, I wrote a proxy server who listens to port number 62106 to get a request and sends back the received data back to client.
 The running command is as below:
	python2 dnsproxy_starter.py --port 62106 --dns_port 62105

-------------------Part3:-------------------
 In this part, I implemented several functions upon the code I wrote in part 2, in this code, I rewrite the IP address and name server in the received data, and send the spoofed data back to the client.
 The running command is as below:
	python2 dnsproxy_starter.py --port 62106 --dns_port 62105 --spoof_response 

-------------------Part4:-------------------
./part4_starter.py --ip 127.0.0.1 --port 62105 --query_port 30889

After randomize the port, the second-try commands are:
./part4_starter.py --ip 127.0.0.1 --port 62013 --query_port 30141
dig @127.0.0.1 NS example.com -p 62013

 In this part, I wrote a program to spoof DNS server, first, I query a random url and then at the same time, I flood DNS server through query port with different transaction ID, which can successfully spoof the server after few interations.
